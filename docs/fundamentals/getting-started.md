# Getting Started with Command Line

Welcome to the beginning of your command line journey! This guide will help you take your first steps into using the command line interface (CLI).

## What is the Command Line?

The command line interface (CLI) is a text-based way to interact with your computer. Instead of using a mouse to click on icons and menus, you type commands to tell the computer what to do.

## Why Use the Command Line?

- **Power and Flexibility**: Many tasks can be accomplished more quickly and efficiently through the command line
- **Automation**: You can easily automate repetitive tasks
- **Remote Access**: Manage remote servers and systems effectively
- **Development**: Essential for software development and system administration

## Opening the Command Line

### Windows
1. Press `Win + R`
2. Type `cmd` and press Enter (for Command Prompt)
3. Or type `powershell` for PowerShell

### Linux
1. Press `Ctrl + Alt + T` (on most distributions)
2. Or search for "Terminal" in your applications menu

### macOS
1. Press `Command + Space`
2. Type "Terminal" and press Enter

## Your First Commands

Let's try some basic commands:

### Windows (Command Prompt)
```cmd
dir           # List files and directories
cd            # Show current directory
cd Documents  # Change to Documents directory
echo Hello    # Print text to screen
```

### Linux/macOS (Terminal)
```bash
ls            # List files and directories
pwd           # Show current directory
cd Documents  # Change to Documents directory
echo "Hello"  # Print text to screen
```

## Next Steps

Now that you know the basics, you can:
- Learn about [Basic Concepts](./basic-concepts.md)
- Explore [Command Line Syntax](./command-syntax.md)
- Check out [Common Commands Reference](../reference/commands.md)

## Tips for Beginners

1. Don't be afraid to experiment
2. Use the help commands (`help` in Windows, `man` in Linux/macOS)
3. Keep this guide handy for reference
4. Practice regularly with simple tasks

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Be careful with destructive commands (delete, move, etc.)
2. Double-check commands before pressing Enter
3. Pay attention to upper/lowercase (Linux/macOS are case-sensitive)
4. Make sure you're in the right directory before executing commands
